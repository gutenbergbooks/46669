<div class="sidenote">1307.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Continuation of <i>Matt. West</i>.</div>

<p>Edward, the second of that name, the sonne of Edward the first, borne at Carnaruan
in Wales, began his reigne ouer England the seauenth day of Iulie, in the yeare
of our Lord 1307, of the world, 5273, of the comming of the Saxons 847, after the conquest
241, about the tenth yeare of Albert emperour of Rome, and the two and twentith
of the fourth Philip, surnamed Le Beau, as then king of France, and in the third yeare
after that Robert le Bruce had taken vpon him the crowne and gouernement of Scotland.
His fathers corpse was conueied from Burgh vpon Sands, vnto the abbie of Waltham,
there to remaine, till things were readie for the buriall, which was appointed at
Westminster.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[Pg 547]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">The bishop of Couentrie committed to prison.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Officers remooued.</div>

<p>Within thr&eacute;e daies after, when the lord treasurer Walter de Langton bishop of Couentrie
and Lichfield (thorough whose complaint P&eacute;ers de Gaueston had b&eacute;ene banished the
land) was going towards Westminster, to make preparation for the same buriall, he was
vpon commandement from the new king arrested, committed to prison, and after deliuered
to the hands of the said P&eacute;ers, being then returned againe into the realme, who
sent him from castell to castell as a prisoner. His lands and tenements were seized
to the kings vse, but his mooueables were giuen to the foresaid P&eacute;ers. Walter Reignold
that had b&eacute;ene the kings tutor in his childhood, was then made lord treasurer, and after
when the s&eacute;e of Worcester was void, at the kings instance he was by the pope to that
bishoprike preferred. Also Rafe bishop of London was deposed from the office of lord
Chancellour, and Iohn Langton bishop of Chichester was thereto restored. Likewise,
the barons of the excheker were remooued, and other put in their places. And Amerie
de Valence earle of Penbroke was discharged of the wardenship of Scotland, and Iohn
de Britaine placed in that office, whom he also made earle of Richmond.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The yeare next insuing, the Ile of Man was taken by Robert Bruce.</div>

<p>But now concerning the demeanour of this new king, whose disordered maners brought
himselfe and manie others vnto destruction; we find that in the beginning of his gouernement,
though he was of nature giuen to lightnesse, yet being restreined with the prudent
aduertisements of certeine of his councellors, to the end that he might shew some likelihood
of good proofe, he counterfeited a kind of grauitie, vertue and modestie; but yet
he could not throughlie be so bridled, but that foorthwith he began to plaie diuers wanton
and light parts, at the first ind&eacute;ed not outragiouslie, but by little and little, and that
couertlie. For hauing reuoked againe into England his old mate the said P&eacute;ers de
Gaueston, he receiued him into most high fauour, creating him earle of Cornewall, and
lord of Man, his principall secretarie, and lord chamberlaine of the realme, through
whose companie and societie he was suddenlie so corrupted, that he burst out into most heinous
vices; for then vsing the said P&eacute;ers as a procurer of his disordred dooings, he began
to haue his nobles in no regard, to set nothing by their instructions, and to take small h&eacute;ed
vnto the good gouernement of the common-wealth, so that within a while, he gaue himselfe
to wantonnes, passing his time in voluptuous pleasure, and riotous excesse: and to
helpe them forward in that kind of life, the foresaid P&eacute;ers, who (as it may be thought,
he had sworne to make the king to forget himselfe, and the state, to the which he was
called) furnished his court with companies of iesters, ruffians, flattering parasites, musicians,
and other vile and naughtie ribalds, that the king might spend both daies and
nights in iesting, plaieng, blanketing, and in such other filthie and dishonorable exercises:
and moreouer, desirous to aduance those that were like to him selfe, he procured
for them honorable offices, all which notable preferments and dignities, sith they were ill
bestowed, were rather to be accounted dishonorable than otherwise, both to the giuer and
the receiuer, sith</p>

<div class="sidenote">A parlement at Northampton.</div>

<div class="sidenote">P&eacute;ers de Gaueston maried.</div>

<p>About the thirt&eacute;enth day of October, a parlement was holden at Northampton, in the
which it was ordeined by the kings appointment, that the coine of his father king Edward
should be still currant, notwithstanding the basenesse thereof, as some reputed it, and
therefore it was mooued in the parlement to haue it disanulled. &para; Also, order was taken
for the buriall of his fathers corpse, which was solemnelie conueied from Waltham, and
brought to Westminster the seauen and twentith day of October following, where with
all funerall pompe it was interred. Moreouer, at the same parlement, a marriage was
concluded betwixt the earle of Cornewall P&eacute;ers de Gaueston, and the daughter of Gilbert
de Clare earle of Glocester, which he had by his wife the countesse Ioane de Acres
the kings sister, which marriage was solemnized on All hallowes day next insuing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sir Iohn Blackwell smoothered and thrust to death. Continuation of <i>N. Triuet.</i></div>

<p>About the two and twentith of Ianuarie, the king sailed ouer into France, and at Bullongne
in Picardie on the foure and twentith day of Ianuarie, he did homage to the
French king for his lands of Gascoine and Pontieu, and on the morrow after, maried
Isabell the French kings daughter, and on the seauenth of Februarie he returned with
hir into England, and comming to London, was ioifullie receiued of the citizens, and on
the fiue and twentith daie of Februarie, being Shrouesundaie in the leape yeare, they
were solemnlie crowned by the bishop of Winchester, bicause that Robert the archbishop
of Canturburie was not as then within the realme. There was such prease and throng
of people at this coronation, that a knight called sir Iohn Bakewell ali&agrave;s Blackwell, was
thrust or crowded to death. &para; On the day of the circumcision this yeare, a great tempest
of thunder and lightning began about euensong time, that continued the most part
of the night following.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The order taken for the apprehension of the t&#x0113;plers.</div>

<p>On wednesdaie after the Epiphanie, the knights templers in England were apprehended
all in one day by the kings commandement, vpon suspicion of hainous crimes &amp; great
enormities by them practised, contrarie to the articles of the christian faith. The order
of their apprehension was on this wise. The king directed his writs vnto all and euerie
the shiriffes of counties within the realme, that they should giue summons to a certeine
number of substantiall persons, knights or other men of good accompt, to be afore them
at certeine places within their gouernements, named in the same writs, on the sunday the
morrow after the Epiphanie then next insuing, and that the said shiriffes faile not to be
there the same day in their owne persons, to execute that which in other writs to them
directed, and after to be sent, should be conteined. The date of this writ was the fift&eacute;enth
of December.</p>

<p>The second writ was sent by certeine chapleins, in which the shiriffes were commanded
vpon the opening of the same, foorthwith to receiue an oth in presence of the said chapleins,
to put in execution all that was therein conteined, and not to disclose the contents
to any man, till they had executed the same with all expedition, and therewith to take the
like oth of those persons, whom by vertue of the first writ they had summoned to appeare
afore them. An other writ there was also framed &amp; sent by the same chapleins, by the
which the said shiriffes were commanded to attach by their bodies, all the templers within
the precinct of their gouernements, and to seize all their lands and goods into the kings
hands, togither with their writings, charters, d&eacute;eds, and miniments, and to make thereof
a true inuentarie and indenture, in presence of the warden of the place, whether he were
brother of that order, or any other, &amp; in presence of honest men being neighbors; of
which indenture, one part to remaine in the custodie of the said warden, and the other
with the shiriffe, vnder his seale that should so make seizure of the said goods: and further,
that the said goods and chattels should be put in safe custodie, and that the quicke
goods and cattell should be kept and found of the premisses as should s&eacute;eme most expedient,
and that their lands and possessions should be manured and tilled to the vttermost
commoditie.</p>

<p>Further, that the persons of the said templers being attached, in manner as before is
said, should be safelie kept in some competent place out of their owne houses, but not in
streight prison, but in such order, as the shiriffes might be sure of them to bring them
foorth when he should be commanded, to be found in the meane time according to their
estate of their owne goods so seized, and hereof to make a true certificat vnto the treasurer
and barons of the excheker, what they had doone concerning the premisses, declaring
how manie of the said templers they had attached, with their names, and what
lands and goods they had seized by vertue of this precept. The date of these two last
writs was from Biflet the 20 of December, and the returne thereof to be made vnto the
excheker, was the morrow after the Purification. There were writs also directed into
Ireland, as we haue there made mention, and likewise vnto Iohn de Britaine earle of
Richmond the lord warden of Scotland, &amp; to Eustace de Cotesbach chamberleine of
Scotland, to Walter de Pederton iustice of Westwales, and to Hugh Aldighle ali&agrave;s Audlie
iustice of Northwales, to Robert Holland iustice of Chester, vnder like forme and maner
as in Ireland we haue expressed.</p>

<p>The malice which the lords had conceiued against the earle of Cornewall still increased,
the more ind&eacute;ed through the high bearing of him, being now aduanced to honour. For
being a goodlie gentleman and a stout, he would not once y&eacute;eld an inch to any of them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[Pg 549]</a></span>
which worthilie procured him great enuie amongst the ch&eacute;efest p&eacute;eres of all the realme,
as sir Henrie Lacie earle of Lincolne, sir Guie earle of Warwike, and sir Aimer de Valence
earle of Penbroke, the earles of Glocester, Hereford, Arundell, and others, which
vpon such wrath and displeasure as they had conceiued against him, thought it not conuenient
to suffer the same any longer, in hope that the kings mind might happilie be
altered into a better purpose, being not altogither conuerted into a venemous disposition,
but so that it might be cured, if the corrupter thereof were once banished from him.</p>

<p>Herevpon they assembled togither in the parlement time, at the new temple, on saturdaie
next before the feast of saint Dunstan, and there ordeined that the said P&eacute;ers should
abiure the realme, and depart the same on the morrow after the Natiuitie of saint Iohn
Baptist at the furthest, and not to returne into the same againe at any time then after to
come. To this ordinance the king (although against his will) bicause he saw himselfe and
the realme in danger, gaue his consent, and made his letters patents to the said earles and
lords, to witnesse the same.</p>

<p>These letters were read, heard, and allowed in the presence of all the Noble men of
this land, the day and yeare abouesaid. &para; The archbishop of Canturburie, being latelie
returned from Rome, where he had remained in exile in the late deceassed kings daies
for a certeine time, did pronounce the said P&eacute;ers accursed, if he taried within the
realme longer than the appointed time, and likewise all those that should aid, helpe or
mainteine him, as also if he should at any time hereafter returne againe into the land.</p>

<p>To conclude, this matter was so followed, that at length he was constreined to withdraw
himselfe to Bristow, and so by sea as a banished man to saile into Ireland.</p>

<p>The king being sore offended herewith, as he that fauoured the earle more than that he
could be without his companie, threatned the lords to be reuenged for this displeasure,
and ceassed not to send into Ireland vnto P&eacute;ers, comforting him both with fr&eacute;endlie mesages,
and rich presents, and as it were to shew that he meant to reteine him still in his
fauour, he made him ruler of Ireland as his deputie there. A wonderfull matter that
the king should be so inchanted with the said earle, and so addict himselfe, or rather fix
his hart vpon a man of such a corrupt humor, against whome the heads of the noblest
houses in the land were bent to deuise his ouerthrow: but the lesse maruell it is that the
king bare him such a feruant affection, and set his hart vpon him, considering that</p>

<p>The lords perceiuing the kings affection, and that the treasure was spent as lauishlie as
before, thought with themselues that it might be that the king would both amend his passed
trade of life, and that P&eacute;ers being restored home, would rather aduise him thereto,
than follow his old maners, considering that it might be well perceiued, that if he continued
in the incouraging of the king to lewdnesse, as in times past he had doone, he could
not thinke but that the lords would be readie to correct him, as by proofe he had now
tried their meanings to be no lesse. Herevpon to reteine amitie, as was thought on both
sides, P&eacute;ers by consent of the lords was restored home againe (the king m&eacute;eting him at
Chester) to his great comfort and reioising for the time, although the malice of the lords
was such, that such ioy lasted not long.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The addition to <i>Triuet.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote">The earle of Cornewall placed in Bambourgh castell.</div>

<p>In the fourth yeare of king Edward was a councell holden at London against the templers,
the which councell indured from the beginning of Maie, till Iune. In this councell
they confessed the fame, but not the fact of the crimes laid to their charge, except two
or thr&eacute;e ribalds that were amongst them: but bicause they could not cleare themselues,
they were adiudged vnto perpetuall penance within certeine monasteries. The king this
yeare fearing the enuie of the lords against P&eacute;ers de Gaueston, placed him for his more
safetie in Bambourgh castell, bearing the prelats and lords in hand, that he had committed
him there to prison for their pleasures.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Polydor.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Caxton.</i></div>

<p>This yeare also there were ordinances made for the state and gouernement of the
realme, by the prelats, earles and barons, which were confirmed with the sentence of excommunication
against all them that should go about to breake the same. The king
neither allowed of them nor obserued them, although he had confirmed them with his
seale, and sent them to all cathedrall churches and counties, to be registered in perpetuall
memorie thereof. The king ind&eacute;ed was lewdlie led, for after that the earle of Cornewall
was returned into England, he shewed himselfe no changeling (as writers doo affirme)
but through support of the kings fauour, bare himselfe so high in his doings, which were
without all good order, that he s&eacute;emed to disdaine all the p&eacute;eres &amp; barons of the realme.
Also after the old sort he prouoked the king to all naughtie rule and riotous demeanour,
and hauing the custodie of the kings iewels and treasure, he tooke out of the iewell-house
a table, &amp; a paire of trestels of gold, which he deliuered vnto a merchant called Aimerie
de Friscobald, commanding him to conueie them ouer the sea into Gascoine. This
table was iudged of the common people, to belong sometime vnto king Arthur, and therefore
men grudged the more that the same should thus be sent out of the realme.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Berwike fortified.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The king entred into Scotland.</div>

<p>The king this yeare raised a great power to go into Scotland. And about the feast of
the Assumption of our ladie, hauing with him P&eacute;ers de Gaueston earle of Cornewall, and
the earles of Glocester and Warren, he came to Berwike, which towne he caused to be
fortified with a strong wall, and a mightie d&eacute;epe ditch, and although the other earles
would not come to serue him in that voiage, by reason of a new variance risen amongst
them, yet he marched foorth into Scotland, to s&eacute;eke his aduersarie Robert le Bruce: but
Robert refusing the battell, kept him foorth of the waie, so that the king was driuen to returne
to Berwike againe, without m&eacute;eting with his enimie. And he was no sooner come
backe, but the said Robert and his people entred into Louthian, sore molesting such as
were y&eacute;elded to the king of England. The king aduertised thereof, followed them, but
could doo no good, &amp; so returned. The earle of Cornewall laie at Rockesbourgh, and
the earle of Glocester at Norham to defend those parts. After Candlemasse, the king
sent the earle of Cornewall, with two hundred men of armes to S. Iohns towne, beyond
the Scotish sea, who receiued to the kings peace all those that inhabited beyond that sea
vp to the mounteins. The king laie still at Berwike, but the earles of Glocester and
Warren, after the beginning of Lent, rode into the forest of Solkirke, and receiued the
foresters &amp; other the inhabitants there to the kings peace. &para; In this fift yeare of the
kings reigne, but somwhat before this present, in the yeare 1310, Henrie Lacie earle of
Lincolne gouernour of England in the kings absence departed this life, in whose place
the earle of Glocester was chosen gouernour, and therefore he returned now into England.
This earle of Lincolne was buried in the new worke at Paules. Lieng on his death
bed, he requested (as was reported) Thomas earle of Lancaster, who had married his
daughter, that in any wise he should stand with the other lords in defense of the common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[Pg 551]</a></span>welth,
and to mainteine his quarell against the earle of Cornewall, which request earle
Thomas faithfullie accomplished: for by the pursute of him, and of the earle of Warwike
ch&eacute;efelie, the said earle of Cornewall was at length taken and beheaded (as after
shall appeare.) Some write that king Edward the first vpon his death-bed, charged the
earles of Lincolne, Warwike, and Penbroke, to fores&eacute;e that the foresaid P&eacute;ers returned
not againe into England, least by his euill example he might induce his sonne the prince
to lewdnesse, as before he had alreadie doone.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The earle of Cornewall banished into Flanders.</div>

<p>Thomas earle of Lancaster came towards Berwike, to doo homage to the king for the
earledome of Lincolne fallen to him in right of his wife, now after the deceasse of hir father
the late earle of Lincolne. But he was counselled not to go foorth of the realme to
the king, so that therevpon rose no small displeasure, and great doubt least there would
haue followed ciuill warres about it. Neuerthelesse, at length the king was persuaded to
come ouer the water vnto Hagerston, foure miles distant from Berwike, and there receiued
homage of the earle, and so they continued fr&eacute;ends, and for that time departed

by that naughtie man (as they tooke it) the earle of Cornewall, assembled at Lincolne,
and there tooke counsell togither, and concluded eftsoones to banish him out of the

other haue, within the quindene of saint Michaell, he was exiled into Flanders, sore against
the kings will and pleasure, who made such account of him, that (as appeared) he could
not be quiet in mind without his companie, &amp; therefore about Candlemasse he eftsoones reuoked

the earle of Penbroke persuaded with the barons to grant to the kings desire, vndertaking
vpon forfeiture of all that he had, to bring him to the king and backe againe to them, in

<p>When the king had knowledge hereof, he was woonderfullie displeased with those lords

worke them displeasure. This yeare, the thirt&eacute;enth of Nouember, the kings eldest sonne
named Edward (which succ&eacute;eded his father in the kingdome by the name of Edward the
third) was borne at Windsore. King Edward now after that the foresaid Piers Gaueston
the earle of Cornewall was dead, nothing reformed his maners, but as one that detested
the counsell and admonition of his Nobles, chose such to be about him, and to be of his
priuie councell, which were knowne to be men of corrupt and most wicked liuing (as the
writers of that age report) amongst these were two of the Spensers, Hugh the father, and
Hugh the sonne, which were notable instruments to bring him vnto the liking of all kind

he procured that a parlement was called at London. In the which manie good ordinances

winning out of the Englishmens hands such castels as they held within Scotland, chasing

Also the Scotishmen aduanced highlie in their minds for the late gotten victorie,

<p>In the eleuenth yeare of king Edward the second his reigne, vpon the saturdaie night
before Midlent sundaie, the towne of Berwike was betraied to the Scots, through the treason
of Peter Spalding. The castell held good tacke a while, till for want of vittels they
within were constreined to deliuer it into the Scotishmens hands, who wan also the same
time the castell of Harbotell, Werke, and Medford, so that they possessed the more part
of all Northumberland, euen vnto Newcastell vpon Tine, sauing that certeine other castels
were defended against them. In Maie they entred with an armie further into the land,
burning all the countrie before them, till they came to Ripon, which towne they spoiled,
and tarieng there thr&eacute;e daies, they receiued a thousand marks of those that were got into
the church, and defended it against them, for that they should spare the towne, and not put
it to the fire, as they had alreadie doone the townes of Northalerton and Bourghbridge as
they came forwards. In their going backe they burnt Knaresbourgh, and Skipton in
Crauen, which they had first sacked, and so passing through the middest of the countrie,
burning and spoiling all before them, they returned into Scotland with a maruellous great
multitude of cattell, beside prisoners, men and women, and no small number of poore
people, which they tooke with them to helpe to driue the cattell.</p>

<p>In the 12 yeare of Edward the seconds reigne, in August, the king and the earle of
Lancaster came to talke togither in a plaine beside Leicester, where they were made fr&eacute;ends
to the outward shew, so that in the yeare next following, the said earle went with the king
to the siege of Berwike. About the feast of the Natiuitie of our ladie, the two cardinals,
which were yet remaining in England, sent foorth commandements vnto all the prelats
and priests within the realme, that thr&eacute;e times in euerie solemne masse, they should denounce
Robert Bruce that called himselfe king of Scotland accursed, with all his councellors
and fautors, and on the behalfe of the pope, they depriued him by denunciation of
all honour, and put all his lands vnder interdiction, disabling all their children [to the
second degr&eacute;e] that held with him, as vnworthie &amp; vnfit to receiue or take vpon them any
ecclesiasticall function. They denounced also all the prelats of Scotland and men of

<p>The lord Roger Mortimer returned againe into England, and Alexander Bicnor was
made ch&eacute;efe iustice of Ireland. &para; Also Edward Bruce, with sir Walter and sir Hugh
Lacie, bringing with them a great armie, returned out of Scotland, and arriued at Dundalke,
on the day of saint Calixt the pope. But n&eacute;ere to the same place sir Iohn Brimingham,
Richard Tute, and Miles of Verdon, with a power of 1324 men incountred them,
and slue the said Edward le Bruce, and aboue the number of 8200 men, or (as other haue)
but 5800. The said sir Iohn Birmingham brought the head of Edward le Bruce ouer into
England, and presented it to the king. Wherevpon the king in recompense of his seruice,
gaue vnto him the earledome of Louth, to hold to him and his heires males, and the baronie
of Athird to him and his heires generall.</p>

<p>About this season, or somewhat before, about Midsummer (as Southwell saith) a
naughtie fellow called Iohn Poidras, or (as some books haue) Ponderham, a tanners son
of Excester comming to Oxford, and there thrusting himselfe into the kings hall that stood
without the wals, gaue foorth that he was sonne and right heire of king Edward the first,
and that by means of a false nursse he was stolne out of his cradle, and this Edward the
second being a carters son was brought in and laid in his place, so that he by reason
thereof was afterwards hardlie fostered and brought vp in the north part of Wales. At
length being laid for, he fled to the church of the white friers in Oxford, trusting there to be
safe through the immunitie of the place, bicause king Edward the first was their founder.
But when he could not k&eacute;epe his toong, but still fondlie vttered his follie, and stood in his
opinion, so that great rumor thereof was raised, he was at length taken out of that church,
&amp; caried to Northampton, where he was there arreigned, condemned, and had foorth to a
place in the countrie called the copped oke, where he was drawne, hanged, and as a
traitour bowelled. At the houre of his death he confessed, that in his house he had a

<div class="sidenote">The king goeth to Berwike. The Scots come into the parts of Yorke.</div>

<p>In this season, to wit, in the yeare 1319, a great murreine and death of cattell chanced
through the whole realme, spreading from place to place, but speciallie this yeare it reigned
in the north, where as in the yeares before it began in the south parts. The king
desirous to be reuenged of the Scots, made preparation to leuie a mightie armie; and for
want of sufficient numbers of men in other places towards the north parts, the king caused
much people to come vnto him out of the south and east parts of the realme, amongst the
which the citie of London was constreined to find at their costs and charges two hundred
men, sending them to Yorke, where the generall assemblie of the armie was made. From
thence, after he had receiued his men from sundrie countries and good townes of his
realme, he went to Berwike, &amp; laid siege to the towne. In which meane time the Scots
being assembled, came to the borders, passed by the English host, and entring into England,
came in secr&eacute;et wise downe into the marches of Yorkeshire, and there slue the people,
and robbed them in most cruell wise.</p>

<p>Wherefore the archbishop of Yorke, meaning in time of such necessitie to doo his
indeuour in defense of his countrie, assembled such power as he could get togither, of
clearkes, moonks, canons, and other spirituall men of the church, with husbandmen and
such other vnapt people for the warres: and thus with a great number of men and few
warlike or discr&eacute;et ch&eacute;efeteins, he togither with the bishop of Elie, as then lord chancellour,
came foorth against the Scots, and incountred with them at a place called Mitton
vpon Suale, the twelfth day of October. Here as the Englishmen passed ouer the water
of Suale, the Scots set fire vpon certeine stacks of haie, the smoke whereof was so huge,
that the Englishmen might not s&eacute;e where the Scots laie. And when the Englishmen were
once got ouer the water, the Scots came vpon them with a wing in good order of battell,
in fashion like to a sh&eacute;eld, egerlie assailing their enimies, who for lacke of good gouernement
were easilie beaten downe and discomfited, without shewing any great resistance:
so that there were slaine to the number of two thousand and the residue shamefullie put
to flight.</p>

<p>The archbishop, the lord chancellor, and the abbat of Selbie, with helpe of their swift

slaine, &amp; sir William Diremin pr&eacute;est taken prisoner. Manie were drowned, by reason
that the Scots had gotten betwixt the Englishmen and the bridge, so that the Englishmen
fled betwixt that wing of the Scots and their maine battell, which had compassed the
Englishmen about on the one side, as the wing did vpon the other. And bicause so manie
spirituall men died in this battell, it was after named of manie writers the white battell.
The king of England informed of this ouerthrow giuen by the Scots to the Northerne
men, he brake vp his siege incontinentlie, and returned to Yorke.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Scots eftsoons accursed.</div>

<p>In this thirt&eacute;enth yeare of his reigne, in Iune king Edward went ouer into France,
where at Amiens he found the French king, of whome he receiued the countie of Pontieu,
which the said French king vpon his comming to the crowne had seized into his
hands, bicause the king of England had not doone to him his homage due for the same.
Also this yeare the pope granted to the king of England the tenth of ecclesiasticall reuenues
for one yeare, as before that time he had likewise doone. &para; About this season,
pope Iohn, being informed of the great destruction and vnmercifull warre which the Scots
made vpon the Englishmen, and namelie for that they spared neither church nor chapell,
abbeie nor priorie, he sent a generall sentence vnder his bulles of lead vnto the archbishop
of Canturburie and Yorke, appointing them that if Robert le Bruce the Scotish king
would not recompense king Edward for all such harmes as the realme of England had by
him susteined, and also make restitution of the goods that had b&eacute;ene taken out of
churches and monasteries, they should pronounce the same sentence against him and his
complices.</p>

<p>Wherevpon when the Scots tooke no regard to the popes admonition, the archbishop
proc&eacute;eded to the pronouncing of the foresaid sentence, so that Robert Bruce, Iames
Dowglas, and Thomas Randulfe earle of Murrey, and all other that kept him companie,
or them in any wise mainteined, were accurssed throughout England euerie day at masse
thr&eacute;e times. Howbeit, this nothing holpe the matter, but put the king and the realme to
great cost and charge, and in the meane season the commons of the realme were sore
oppressed by sundrie waies and means, diuerse of them lost their goods and possessions,
being taken from them vpon surmised and feined quarels, so that manie were vtterlie
vndoone, and a few singular and misordered persons were aduanced.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Scots inuade England.</div>

<p>After the Epiphanie, when the truce failed betwixt the two realmes of England and
Scotland, an armie of Scots entred England, and came into the bishoprike of Durham.
The earle of Murrey staied at Darington, but Iames Dowglas and the steward of Scotland
went foorth to waste the countrie, the one towards Hartlepoole and Cleueland, and
other towards Richmond: but they of the countie of Richmond (as before they had
doone) gaue a great summe of monie to saue their countrie from inuasion. The Scots
at that time remained within England by the space of fift&eacute;ene daies or more. The knights
and gentlemen of the north parts did come vnto the earle of Lancaster that laie the same
time at Pomfret, offering to go foorth with him to giue the enimies battell, if he would
assist them: but the earle s&eacute;emed that he had no lust to fight in defense of his prince,
that sought to oppresse him wrongfullie (as he tooke it) and therefore he dissembled
the matter, and so the Scots returned at their pleasure without encounter.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Thom. Wals.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote">The ch&eacute;efe cause of the variance betwixt y<sup>e</sup> lords and the Sp&#x0113;sers.</div>

<p>About this season, the lord William de Bruce that in the marches of Wales enioied
diuerse faire possessions to him descended from his ancestors, but through want of good
gouernement was run behind hand, offered to sell a certeine portion of his lands called
Gowers land lieng in the marches there, vnto diuerse noble men that had their lands adioining
to the same, as to the earle of Hereford, and to the two lords Mortimers, the
vncle &amp; nephue, albeit the lord Mowbraie that had maried the onelie daughter and heire
of the lord Bruce, thought verelie in the end to haue had it, as due to his wife by right of
inheritance. But at length (as vnhap would) Hugh Spenser the yoonger lord chamberleine,
coueting that land (because it laie n&eacute;ere on each side to other lands that he had in
those parts) found such means through the kings furtherance and helpe, that he went
awaie with the purchase, to the great displeasure of the other lords that had b&eacute;ene in
hand to buie it.</p>

<p>Hereby such hartburning rose against the Spensers, that vpon complaint made by the
erle of Hereford vnto the earle of Lancaster, of their presumptuous dealing, by ruling all
things about the king as s&eacute;emed best to their likings, it was thought expedient by the said
earles that some remedie in time (if it were possible) should be prouided. Wherevpon
the said earls of Lancaster and Hereford, with the lords Roger Tuchet, Roger Clifford,
Iocelin Deieuille, Roger Bernsfield, the two Mortimers, Roger the vncle and Roger the
nephue, William de Sullie, William de Elmbrige, Iohn Gifford of Brimesfield, and Henrie
Tieis, all barons; the which with diuerse other lords and knights, and men of name,
assembling togither at Shierborne in Elmedone, sware each of them to stand by other,
till they had amended the state of the realme. But yet notwithstanding this their oth,
the most part of them afterwards forsaking the enterprise, submitted themselues to the
king.</p>

<p>Neuerthelesse, whether for that the king by a proclamation set foorth the sixt&eacute;enth of
March, had commanded (as some write) that the lords Mowbraie, Clifford, and Deieuille
for disobeieng to make their personall appearance before him, should auoid the land
within ten daies next insuing, or for that they meant with all sp&eacute;ed to put their enterprise
in execution, we find that the earle of Hereford, the lords Mortimer, the vncle and
nephue, the lord Roger Damorie, the lord Iohn Mowbraie, the lord Hugh Audelie, and
his sonne named also Hugh, the lord Clifford, the lord Iohn Gifford of Brimesfield, the
lord Morice Berkeley, the lord Henrie Tieis, the lord Iohn Matrauers, with manie other
that were alied togither, hauing the consent also of the earle of Lancaster, on the wednesdaie
next after the feast of the Inuention of the crosse, hauing with them to the number
of eight hundred men of armes, fiue hundred hoblers, and ten thousand men on foot,
came with the kings banner spread vnto Newport in Wenloks lands, where they tooke the
castell that belonged vnto the lord chamberleine Hugh Spenser the yoonger.</p>

<div class="sidenote">They inuade the Spensers lands.</div>

<p>They also tooke Kaerdie, Kersillie, Lantrissane, Taluan, Lamblethian, Kenefegis,
Neoth, Drusselan, and Diuenor; part of his men which in the foresaid places they found,
they slue, as sir Iohn Iwain, and sir Matthew de Gorges knights, with 15 other of his
men that were Welshmen: part they tooke and put them in prison, as sir Rafe or Randulfe
de Gorges being sore wounded, sir Philip Ioice, sir Iohn de Frissingfield, sir Iohn
de Dunstable, William de Dunstable, and manie other, of the which the most part were
put to their ransome. They tooke, spoiled and destroied so much in value of his goods
as amounted vnto two thousand pounds. They tooke vp in such debts as were owing to
him in those parts, to the summe of thr&eacute;e thousand pounds, and of his rents to the value
n&eacute;ere hand of a thousand pounds. They burnt 23 of his manors which he had in those
parts of Wales, with his barnes, and did what hurt they could deuise, burning or taking
awaie all his writings and euidences. After they had remained 15 daies there, they came
into England, with the like force and disorder inuading his castels, manors and possessions,
so that the damage which they did here vnto the said lord chamberleine, amounted
to the value of ten thousand pounds.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The king sendeth to the lords.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The lord Badelismere reuolteth to the side of the barons.</div>

<p>The king aduertised of their dooings, sent vnto them the archbishop of Canturburie,
and the lord Bartholomew de Badelismere lord steward of his house, to request them to
desist and leaue off from such their outragious dooings, and comming to the parlement
which he had alreadie summoned, they might put in their complaints and grieuances, &amp;
he would s&eacute;e that they should haue iustice, according as equitie should require. The
lord Badelismere forsaking the king, became one of the confederacie with the barons,
and so the archbish. was glad to returne alone, leauing the L. Badelismere behind him,
who sent the king word by the archbishop, that till they had expelled the Spensers out of
the realme, they would not giue ouer their enterprise. On saint Barnabies day they came
to a manour of Hugh Spenser the father called Fasterne, in the countie of Wiltshire, and
spoiled the same with diuerse and manie other manors, as well in Wiltshire, as else where,
to wit, in Glocestershire, Dorsetshire, Hamshire, Barkeshire, Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire,
Surrie, Cambridgeshire, Huntingtonshire, Leicestershire, Lincolnshire, Chesshire,
and Warwikeshire, making such hauocke of all such goods or cattell as belonged to the
said Hugh Spenser the father, that he was thought to be indamaged to the value of thirtie
thousand pounds, burning his houses, beating, maiming and ransoming his men.</p>

<p>Furthermore not contented to spoile those places which belonged to him, but hearing
that in the abbeie of Stanlie he had laid vp monie and euidences, they brake into that
abbeie, and tooke out thereof a thousand pounds in readie coine, beside euidences and
writings, to the indamaging of him to the value of six thousand pounds, and likewise
entring into the castell of Marleburgh, where the said Hugh Spenser the father had laid
vp in wooll to the number of 36 sacks, they tooke the same and other of his goods, as
well in plate as apparell, to the value in all of six thousand pounds. And they did not
onelie spoile the possessions, houses, goods, and cattels of the two Spensers, whersoeuer
they could heare that the same were to be found, but also they vsed the like disorder
against all such as were knowne to be fr&eacute;ends or well-willers, to either the father or sonne,
sending commissions vnto such as should s&eacute;e the same executed to the most extremitie,
so that in this rage of enuie and hot reuenge there was no parcialitie, but that one with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[Pg 561]</a></span>

<div class="sidenote">Their requests.</div>

<p>finallie, after they had satisfied their desires in such riotous sort, they raised the people,
and constrained them to sweare to be of their accord, and so came forward with the like
force towards the parlement that was summoned to be holden at London thr&eacute;e w&eacute;eks
after Midsummer. At their comming to S. Albons, they sent the bishops of London,
Salisburie, Elie, Hereford, and Chichester, to the king with their humble suit in outward
apperance, though in effect and verie d&eacute;ed more presumptuous than was requisite. Their
ch&eacute;efe request was that it might please his highnesse to put from him the Spensers, whose
counsell they knew to be greatlie against his honour, and hereof not to faile if he tendered
the quiet of his realme. They also required letters patents of him, containing a generall
pardon for the indemnitie of themselues, and all those that had b&eacute;ene in armes with them,
so as they should not be impeached by the king for any transgressions past or present, in
time hereafter to come.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The kings answer.</div>

<p>The king herevnto answered, that as concerning Hugh Spenser the father, he was
abroad on his busines beyond the seas, and that Hugh the sonne was on the sea for the
safe k&eacute;eping of the cinque ports, as by his office he was bound, and that they ought not
by any right or custome to be banished, before they haue made answere to the crimes
obiected against them. He added further, that their request wanted foundation of law
and reason. And if it might be proued that the Spensers had in any wise offended against
the statutes and ordinances of the land, they were alwaies readie to make their answere
as the lawes of the realme should require. Lastlie he added this with an oth, that he
would not be forsworne contrarie to that which at his coronation he had taken vpon him
by oth, through granting letters of peace and pardon to such notorious offenders in contempt
of his person, and to the trouble and disquieting of the whole realme.</p>

parlement, which the king had summoned to begin at Westminster thr&eacute;e w&eacute;ekes after
Midsummer. Their retinue were apparelled in a sute of iakets or coats of colours demie,
partie yellow and gr&eacute;ene with a band of white cast ouerthwart. By reason whereof that
parlement long after was called The parlement of white bands. Then to s&eacute;e the kings
peace kept within the citie, the maior caused a thousand men well armed to watch dailie
in diuerse wards, &amp; at diuerse gates of the citie, which watch began at foure of the clocke
in the morning, and so continued till six at night, and then as manie were appointed to
the night watch, continuing the same till the houre of fiue in the morning. And for the
more suertie that this night watch should be well and sufficientlie kept, two aldermen
were assigned nightlie to ride about the citie with certeine officers of the towne, to s&eacute;e
the watchmen well and discr&eacute;etlie guided. The gates were shut at nine of the clocke &amp;
opened againe at seauen in the morning. Also euerie citizen was warned to haue his

<div class="sidenote">The Spensers banished by the decr&eacute;e of the barons.</div>

<p>Neuerthelesse the barons being come in forceable wise (as y&eacute;e haue heard) vnto this
parlement, they constreined the earle of Richmond, Arundell, Warren, and Penbroke, to
agr&eacute;e vnto their purpose; and likewise some of the bishops they compelled through feare
to take an oth to ioine with them in their purpose, for the expelling of the Spensers out of
the realme, and so comming all togither before the king, they published certeine articles
against the said Spensers, both the father and sonne, wherevpon they made an award, that
they should be disherited and banished the land during their liues, if by the king and
consent of all the lords in parlement assembled, they should not be restored. They had
day and place appointed where to passe foorth of the land, to wit, at Douer, and not elsewhere,
betwixt the daie of his award made, and the feast of the decollation of saint Iohn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[Pg 562]</a></span>
Baptist, that day to be counted for one. Diuers articles (as before is said) were laid to the
charge of those Spensers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Articles wherwith the barons charged the Sp&#x0113;sers.</div>

<p>1 Amongst other things it was alledged; First that Hugh Spenser the sonne, being on a
time angrie and displeased with the king, sought to allie and confederate himselfe with the
lord Gifford of Brimesfield, and the lord Richard Gray to haue constreined and forced the
king by strong hand to haue followed his will and pleasure.</p>

<p>2 Secondlie it was alledged, that the said Spensers as well the father as the sonne, had
caused the king to ride into Glocestershire, to oppresse and destroie the good people of his
land, contrarie to the forme of the great charter.</p>

<p>3 Thirdlie, that where the earle of Hereford, and the lord Mortimer of Wigmore, had
gone against one Thlewillin Bren, who had raised a rebellion against the king in Glamorganshire,
whiles the lands of the earle of Glocester were in the kings hands, the same
Thlewillin y&eacute;elded himselfe to the said earle, and to the lord Mortimer, who brought him
to the king, vpon promise that he should haue the kings pardon, and so the king receiued
him. But after that the said earle and lord Mortimer were out of the land, the Spensers
taking to them roiall power, tooke the said Thlewillin and led him vnto Kardif, where after
that the said Hugh Spenser the sonne had his purpartie of the said earle of Glocesters lands,
he caused the said Thlewillin to be drawne, headed and quartered, to the discredit of the
king, and of the said earle of Hereford and lord Mortimer, yea and contrarie to the lawes
and dignitie of the imperiall crowne.</p>

<p>4 Fourthlie, the said Spensers counselled the king to foreiudge sir Hugh Audlie, sonne
to the lord Hugh Audlie, and to take into his hands his castels and possessions. They
compassed also to haue atteinted the lord Roger Damorie, that thereby they might haue
enioied the whole earledome of Glocester.</p>

<p>These and other articles of misdemeanour in the Spensers were exhibited, to persuade
the king and others, that they were vnprofitable members in the common-wealth, and not
worthie of those places which they occupied. Now after that their disheriting and banishment
was concluded in manner as before is said, the earle of Hereford and other the lords
that had prosecuted the quarell against them, came before the king, and humblie on their
kn&eacute;es besought him of pardon for all things which they had committed against him, his
lawes, or any other person in the pursuit of the said Spensers. The king, being brought
into a streict, durst not but grant vnto all that which they requested, establishing the same
by statute.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The king goeth to Canturburie.</div>

<div class="sidenote">He commeth to talke with the lord chamberlaine.</div>

<p>The parlement being thus ended, the king and qu&eacute;ene went to Canturburie, there to
visit the shrine of Thomas Becket somtime archbishop there. From thence he went to the
Ile of Tenet, that he might m&eacute;et with his deare &amp; welbeloued councellour Hugh Spenser
the yoonger, whome he had of late sent in ambassage vnto the French king, and now being
returned by sea into those parts, he was desirous to s&eacute;e him, that he might haue conference
with him: and so comming togither, they spent certeine daies in commoning of such matters
as they thought good. The king calling to him the mariners of the cinques ports, committed
to them the custodie of the said Hugh, who for a time kept him with them in their
ships, and the king sailing alongst the coast to Porchester, conferred with him of manie
things.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The qu&eacute;ene not suffered to lodge in the castell of L&eacute;eds.</div>

<p>From Porchester the king ment to returne vnto London, there to m&eacute;et the qu&eacute;ene, who
in hir returne from Canturburie would haue lodged one night in the castell of L&eacute;eds,
which the lord Bartholomew de Badelismere late steward of the kings house had by
exchange of the king for other lands, and now taking part with the barons, had left his
wife and children with other of his fr&eacute;ends and treasure in the same castell. Those that
were put in trust with k&eacute;eping this castell, would neither permit qu&eacute;ene nor other to enter
therein, without expresse commandement from their lord and maister, and so they signified
not onelie to the qu&eacute;enes seruants that came before to make prouision for hir, but also
declared the same to hirselfe comming thither in person.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[Pg 563]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The king besiegeth the castell of L&eacute;eds.</div>

<p>This chanced verie vnluckilie for the barons: for where the qu&eacute;ene had euer sought to
procure peace, loue and concord betwixt the king and his lords, sh&eacute;e tooke such displeasure
with this deniall made to hir for one nights lodging in that castell, that vpon hir
gr&eacute;euous complaint sent to the king, he foorthwith raised a mightie armie out of Kent and
Essex, from the cinque ports, and of the Londoners, and hauing with him his brethren,
Thomas earle Marshall, and Edmund earle of Kent, also the earls of Richmond, Penbroke,
Arundell, and Atholl, he hasted thither, &amp; laid siege about the castell; constreining them
within by all meanes that might be deuised.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The lords came with a power to raise the siege.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The castell of L&eacute;eds y&eacute;elded.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Walter Culpepper executed.</div>

<p>In the meane time, at the suit of the lord Badelismere, the earle of Hereford, and other
lords of the confederacie, came with a great power vnto Kingstone, about the feast of
Simon and Iude, and there staieng certeine daies for some of their companie that were to
come vnto them, they sent vnto the king the archbishop of Canturburie, and the bishop of
London, with the earle of Penbroke, requiring him to remooue his siege, till by parlement
some order might be taken: but the king would not giue eare to their suit, but continued
his siege till the castell was y&eacute;elded to him. For those that were at Kingstone cowardlie
leuing their enterprise, came not forward, but returned backe againe. They that were
within the castell, hauing simplie submitted themselues to the king, caused twelue or thirt&eacute;ene
of them to suffer death. Amongst other was one Walter Culpepper reckoned for
the ch&eacute;efe of them that defended the castell against the king. The wife of the lord
Badelismere, with his nephue Bartholomew de Burwash was sent to the tower of London,
but his sister was sent to Douer castell, there to remaine in safe k&eacute;eping. The castell of
L&eacute;eds being thus y&eacute;elded to the king, he entred the same on All halowes daie, and shortlie
after the castell of Chilham was deliuered, and the castell of Tunbridge left void by them
that had it in k&eacute;eping. The king thus bestirring him, came into Essex, and seized into his
hands the lands of the lord Badelismere, and likewise the lands of such as were his mainteiners,
abbettors, fr&eacute;ends, fauourers, and furtherers; of the which such as he could m&eacute;et
with he put in prison, and herewith summoned an armie to m&eacute;et him at Cirencester about
saint Lucies day the virgine. And then about saint Andrews tide he came to London,
where the archbishop of Canturburie had called a prouinciall councell.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The lord ch&#x0101;berleine y&eacute;eldeth himselfe to the law.</div>

<p>At the same time Hugh Spenser the sonne, being latelie come from the sea, y&eacute;elded
himselfe prisoner to the kings ward, bes&eacute;eching the king that he might haue right ministred
to him, concerning the wrongs and iniuries to him doone by the barons in maner as before
ye haue heard, speciallie for the award which in parlement they had procured to be enacted
against him, the errours committed in the processe, whereof he besought the king that he
might be admitted to shew: as first, in that they made themselues iudges: secondlie, in
that he was not called to answer: thirdlie, for that the same award was made without the
assent of the prelats, who are p&eacute;eres of the parlement as well as the temporall lords:
fourthlie, in that the said barons had no record in their pursuit vpon the causes conteined
in that award: fiftlie, in that the award was made against the forme of the great charter of
franchises, wherein is conteined that none shall be foreiudged nor destroied but by lawfull
iudgment of his p&eacute;ers, according to the law of the land. Further, he alledged that it was
to be considered, how the said barons and great men being summoned to come in due
maner vnto that parlement, they came in forceable wise with all their powers. A like
petition was also exhibited on the behalfe of Hugh Spenser the father, for redresse to be had
of the wrongs and losses, which in like case he had susteined.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The declaration of the prelats.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The declaration of the earles.</div>

<p>The king fauouring inough the causes and petitions of the Spensers, granted their requests,
and deliuered the petitions vnto the archbishop of Canturburie and his suffragans,
the which at the same time were there assembled in their prouinciall councell aforesaid,
requiring to haue their aduise and opinion therein. He likewise requested of the earles
and barons that were then with him, and of the councellors in law, what they thought of
this matter. The prelats vpon deliberation had declared that in their opinion, the said
award as touching the disheriting and banishing of the Spensers, the father and sonne was
erronious, and not rightlie decr&eacute;ed, and for themselues they denied that they either did or
could thinke it reason to consent therevnto, and therefore they required that it might be
repealed, and the kings brother Edmund earle of Kent, Iohn de Britaine earle of Richmond,
Aimer de Valence earle of Penbroke, and Edmund earle of Arundell, then being in presence
of the king, and likewise of the foresaid prelats, affirmed that the said award pronounced
against the Spensers was made contrarie to law and right, and therefore as the
prelats requested, that the same might be repealed.</p>

<p>Further, the said earles alledged, that the assent which they gaue in the said award, was
for doubt of the vnlawfull force which the barons brought vnto the said parlement, when
they made that award, and for that the said earles that now were with the king, had counselled
him to suffer the said award to passe, for feare of the said force, and confessed they
had doone euill, and besought him of pardon for their offenses in so doing. The king
thus hauing caused the prelats, earles, barons, and lawiers there present to vtter their
iudgements in maner aforesaid, he iudiciallie reuoked and quite disanulled the processe of
the said award, made as well touching the banishment, as the disheriting of the Spensers,
and restored them to his peace and allegiance, and to their former estates, in all conditions
as they inioied the same before the making of the said award, notwithstanding certeine
letters to the contrarie of the earle of Lancaster, and other lords of his faction, which for
the approuing and ratifieng of the said processe they directed vnder their seales to the king
as yet remaining at London.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The barons againe get to armour.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The lord saint Iohn.</div>

<p>They wrote also to the prelats, iustices, and barons of the excheker, to induce the king
to giue his assent to that which in the tenor of their letters was conteined. The earle of
Hereford, the lord Roger Mortimer of Cherke, &amp; the lord Roger Mortimer of Wigmore,
entring the marches of Wales, came to Glocester, and tooke that citie. The castell was
also deliuered vnto them by the constable thereof. The king hauing his people comming
dailie vnto him, whereby his armie was hugelie increased, about the feast of saint Nicholas
he set foorth from London, and with him there went his brother Edmund earle of Kent,
Iohn earle of Richmond, Edmund earle of Arundell, and manie other great lords and
barons. The qu&eacute;ene with hir children he left in the tower of London. The lord Iohn de
saint Iohn comming to submit himselfe vnto the king, at the intercession of diuerse noble
men, with much adoo had his pardon at length granted him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The lord Tieis.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Cirencester.</div>

<p>The king passing forward, seized into his hands the townes, castels, manors, and goods
of them that were against him. But in the meane time the lord Henrie de Tieis, with
certeine other that were entred into Glocestershire (hearing that a great multitude of people
was assembled out of the countrie of Cirencester by the kings commandement) came
thither and chased them home to their houses, putting them in feare of their liues, if they
should offer to resist him. The king comming to Crikelade after the feast of saint Lucie
the virgin, wrote to the earle of Lancaster an answer of his letters, which he had receiued
from him at London, modestlie reprouing him, for that he had so gr&eacute;euouslie and vndutifullie
reproched him, without respect had to his roiall estate, and also presumed to assigne
a daie within the which he should reforme those things which he misliked in him, as if he
were his subiect and vnderling, &amp; beside this was now ioined with his aduersaries against
him, where on his behalfe there had b&eacute;ene no let nor staie at any time, but that they might
be fr&eacute;ends &amp; remaine in quiet togither. Wherein though he did more than stood with
the dignitie of his roiall title, in somuch as he had the earles life at his commandement, yet
for that he tollerated such insolencie of behauiour, as was vns&eacute;emelie to be shewed against
the person of his prince, the kings clemencie and patience is highlie therein to be commended;
though his forbearing and s&eacute;eking means of quietnesse did neuer a whit
amend the malignant mind of the earle, whose hart was so inchanted with ambition
and supereminent honour, that he quite forgat this good lesson of submission and due
allegiance,</p>

<p>From Crikelade the king went to Cirencester, where he held the feast of Christmasse,
the earles of Norffolke, Penbroke, Surrie, and other great lords comming thither to ioine
their powers with his. Thither came also a great strength of footmen, part of the which
vnder the leading of one Robert Aquarij a right famous capteine, tooke the castell of
Bromfield, those that had the k&eacute;eping of it fl&eacute;eing foorth of it. The king comming to
Worcester about Newyeres tide, caused the walles of the citie to be repared, committing
the custodie thereof vnto William de Longchampe. After the Epiphanie he passed on the
side of Seuerne towards Shrewsburie, where, at his comming thither he was honourablie
receiued by the burgesses that came foorth to m&eacute;et him in armor, and so conueied him into
their towne being stronglie fensed. In this meane time the Scots now that the truce
was ended, entring with a strong power into England, destroied all the countrie to Newcastell
vpon Tine with fire and sword. The Welshmen with their capteine Griffin Loitis
tooke the castels in Wales, which were kept by the people of the lord Mortimer the elder.
They tooke also the castels of Mole, Chirke, and Olono, the k&eacute;epers whereof comming
vnto the king to Shrewsburie submitted themselues to him, who shortlie after sent them
to the tower of London. The lord Hugh Audelie the elder, the lord Iohn de Hastings,
and diuerse other comming in, and submitting themselues to the king were likewise committed
to ward. The lord Roger Damorie entring into the citie of Worcester destroied

to passe through the middest of the realme, spoiling by the way mens cattell and goods
verie disorderlie, and so came through to the earle of Lancaster. The king getting into
his hands all the castels of his aduersaries in those parts, went to Hereford, where he was
honorablie receiued of the cleargie and citizens. His armie increased dailie, many comming
in vnto him, that before durst not for feare of his aduersaries. The bishop of Hereford

the lord Hugh Spenser the yoonger, which the barons had the last yeare got into their

&para; The king, after this, comming to Glocester, condemned the shiriffe of Hereford to be

came to the king to Glocester, submitting himselfe to the kings pleasure. After this

his more ease, writing to William Sutton vnder-constable of Warwike castell, commanding
him to be attendant on the shiriffe of Warwike, in helping him to watch the entries

perceiuing the great puissance which the king had there readie to encounter them, without

Notinghamshire, aduertising him both of the successe he had against his enimies, and withall,
pronouncing them and all their adherents, rebels and traitors to him and his realme,
and that for such they should be reputed, taken and vsed. Wherefore he commanded in

should pursue the said rebels, that is, the earles of Lancaster and Hereford, the lords

raise his tenants in Lancashire, and to bring them vnto him, but he deceiued him, and
came not to him at all, wherevpon the earles of Lancaster and Hereford, with the other

<div class="sidenote"><i>Ri. Southwell.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote">He is beheaded.</div>

<p>On the morrow after being mondaie, the two and twentith of March, he was brought
before these noble men, Edmund earle of Kent, Iohn earle of Richmond, Aimer earle of
Penbroke, Iohn erle of Surrie, Edmund earle of Arundell, Dauid earle of Atholl, Robert
earle of Anegos, the lord Hugh Spenser the father, the lord Robert de Malmesthorp iustice,
and others with them associate, before whome he was arreiegned of high treason, for
that he had raised warre against the king, and defended the passage of Burton bridge, for
the space of thr&eacute;e daies togither against him, and after when it was perceiued that the
king had passed the riuer, he with Humfrie de Bohun earle of Hereford, and other their
complices like traitors, set fire on the said towne, and cruellie burnt part of the houses and
men of the same towne, and after, the said earle of Lancaster with his complices, arranged
himselfe in field with his armie and banners displaid readie to fight against the king, till
that perceiuing the kings power to be ouerstrong for him &amp; his partakers to resist, he
togither with them fled, committing by the waie diuerse felonies and roberies, till they
came to Burrough bridge, where finding certeine of the kings faithfull subiects readie to
resist them, they assailed the said faithfull subiects with force of armes and banners displaied,
slaieng diuerse of them, till finallie the said earle of Lancaster was caught, and other
of his complices, some taken, some slaine, and the residue put to flight, so that there wanted
no good will in the said earle of Lancaster and others, whie the king should not haue
b&eacute;ene vanquished. Which treasons, murthers, burning of houses, destroieng of the kings
people, being plainlie &amp; manifestlie knowne to the earls, barons, lords, and other people
of the land, the said earle of Lancaster was therevpon adiudged to die, according to the
law in such cases prouided, that is, to be drawne, hanged, and headed. But bicause he
was the qu&eacute;enes vncle, and sonne to the kings vncle, he was pardoned of all saue heading,
and so accordinglie therevnto suffered at Pomfret the two and twentith of March.</p>

<p>Thus the king s&eacute;emed to be reuenged of the displeasure doone to him by the earle of
Lancaster, for the beheading of P&eacute;ers de Gaueston earle of Cornewall, whom he so
d&eacute;erelie loued, and bicause the earle of Lancaster was the ch&eacute;efe occasioner of his death,
the king neuer loued him entirelie after. &para; So that here is verified the censure of the
scripture expressed by the wisedome of Salomon, that the anger and displeasure of the
king is as the roring of a lion, and his reuenge ineuitable. Wherefore it is an hie point
of discretion in such as are mightie, to take h&eacute;ed how they giue edge vnto the wrath of
their souereigne, which if it be not by submission made blunt, the burthen of the smart
insuing will lie heauie vpon the offender, euen to his vtter vndooing, and losse (perhaps)
of life. In this sort came the mightie earle of Lancaster to his end, being the greatest
p&eacute;ere in the realme, and one of the mightiest earles in christendome: for when he began
to leauie warre against the king, he was possessed of fiue earledomes, Lancaster, Lincolne,
Salisburie, Leicester, and Derbie, beside other seigniories, lands, and possessions,
great to his aduancement in honor and puissance. But all this was limited within prescription
of time, which being expired, both honour and puissance were cut off with dishonour
and death, for (O mutable state!)</p>

<p>But now touching the foresaid earle of Lancaster, great strife rose afterwards amongst
the people, whether he ought to be reputed for a saint or no. Some held, that he ought
to be no lesse est&eacute;emed, for that he did manie almesd&eacute;eds in his life time, honored men
of religion, and mainteined a true quarell till his liues end. Also, his enimies continued
not long after, but came to euill end. Others conceiued an other opinion of him, alledging,
that he fauoured not his wife, but liued in spouse-breach, defiling a great number of
damosels and gentlewomen. If anie offended him, he slue him shortlie after in his
wrathfull mood. Apostataes and other euill dooers he mainteined, and would not suffer
them to be punished by due order of law. All his dooings he vsed to commit vnto one of
his secretaries, and tooke no h&eacute;ed himselfe thereof: and as for the manner of his death,
he fled shamefullie in the fight, and was taken and put to death against his will, bicause
he could not auoid it: yet by reason of certeine miracles which were said to be doone
n&eacute;ere the place both where he suffered, and where he was buried, caused manie to thinke
he was a saint; howbeit, at length, by the kings c&#x014D;mandement, the church doores of the
priorie where he was buried, were shut and closed, so that no man might be suffered to
come to the toome to bring any offerings, or to do any other kind of deuotion to the same.
Also, the hill where he suffered was kept by certeine Gascoignes, appointed by the lord
Hugh Spenser the sonne then lieng at Pomfret, to the end that no people should come
and make their praiers there in worship of the said earle, whome they tooke verelie for a

<p>When the king had subdued the barons, shortlie after, about the feast of the Ascension

of the decr&eacute;e or iudgement concerning the disheriting of the Spensers, ordeined by
the lords in parlement assembled at London the last summer, was now throughlie examined,
and for their errours therein found, the same record and processe was cl&eacute;erelie
adnihilated and reuersed, and the said Spensers were restored to all their lands and
offices, as before. And in the same parlement the lord Hugh Spenser the father was
made earle of Winchester, and the lord Andrew de Herklie earle of Carleill. Moreouer,
in the same parlement, all such were disherited as had taken part with the earls of Lancaster
&amp; Hereford, except the lord Hugh Audelie the yoonger, and a few other, the
which lord Hugh was pardoned, bicause he had married the kings n&eacute;ece, that was sister
to Gilbert de Clare earle of Glocester which was slaine in Scotland, at the battell of Bannockesborne,

<p>At this time also master Robert Baldocke, a man euill beloued in the realme, was

great fauourers of the Spensers, and so likewise was the earle of Arundell, whereby it
may be thought, that the Spensers did helpe to aduance them into the kings fauour, so
that they bare no small rule in the realme, during the time that the same Spensers continued
in prosperitie, which for the terme of fiue yeares after that the foresaid barons (as before
is expressed) were brought to confusion, did woonderfullie increase, and the qu&eacute;ene

he commanded that the same should be called statutes, and not ordinances. Beside a
great subsidie granted to the king by the temporaltie, the cleargie of all the prouince of
Canturburie granted fiue pence of euerie marke, and they of the prouince of Yorke foure
pence. Aimer earle of Penbroke, being returned home from this parlement holden at
Yorke, was arrested by certeine knights, sent with authoritie therevnto from the king,
who brought him backe to Yorke, where at length thorough suit of certeine noble men,
he was vpon his oth taken to be a faithfull subiect, and in consideration of a fine which
he paied to the king, set at libertie. The occasion of his imprisonment came, for that he

that present, was for that they were in hope to recouer all the lands which the king of
England held within France, cl&eacute;erelie out of his hands, for so much as they vnderstood the
discord betwixt him and his barons, and how infortunatlie he had sped against the Scots,
by reason whereof they iudged the time to serue most fitlie now for their purpose.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Merimouth.</i></div>

<p>In the octaues of the natiuitie of saint Iohn Baptist, Robert Bruce entring into England
by Carleill, kept on his waie through Cumberland, Coupeland, Kendall, and so into Lancashire,
till he came to Preston in Andernesse, which towne he burnt, as he had doone
others in the countries through which he had passed. There were some of the Scots that
forraied the countrie fiue miles on this side Preston southwards, and thus being fourescore
long miles within England, they returned homewards, and entred againe into Scotland
without incounter, after they had b&eacute;ene at this time within England the space of thr&eacute;e
w&eacute;eks and thr&eacute;e daies. King Edward being thus beset with two mischiefes both at one
time, thought good first to prouide remedie against the n&eacute;erer danger, which by the Scots
was still at hand, and therefore he meant to go against them himselfe, and to send his
brother Edmund earle of Kent into Guien, to defend that countrie from the Frenchmen.
Herevpon now in the sixt&eacute;enth yeare of his reigne, after that the Scots were returned
home with a great bootie and rich spoile, he got togither a wonderfull great armie of men,
and entring into Scotland, passed far within the countrie, not finding any resistance at all
(as the most part of our writers doo agr&eacute;e) but at length, through famine and diseases of
the flix and other maladies that fell amongst the Englishmen in the armie, he was constreined
to come backe, and in his waie besieged the castell of Norham, which fortresse he
wan within ten daies after he had begun to assault it.</p>

<p>Robert Bruce immediatlie after the English armie was retired home, raised a power, and
entring into England by Sulwaie sands laie at a place called Beaumond, not past thr&eacute;e
miles fr&#x014D; Carleill, by the space of fiue daies, sending in the meane time the most part of
his armie abroad to spoile and harrie the countrie on euerie side, and afterwards remouing
from thence, he passed towards Blackamore, hauing knowledge by diligent espials, that
king Edward was in those parts, giuing himselfe more to pastime in hunting there within
the woods about Blackamore, than to the good ordering of his people which he had then
about him. Wherevpon the Scotish king Bruce, entring into that wild and moorish countrie,
where he had not b&eacute;ene afore, conueied his enterprise so warilie, and with such
diligent industrie, that on saint Lukes daie, comming vpon the English armie at vnwares,
he put the same to flight, so that the king himselfe was in great danger to haue b&eacute;ene taken
prisoner. For (as some authors write) the Scots had almost taken him at dinner in the
abbeie of Beighland. Sir Iohn Britaine earle of Richmond was taken at this battell, and
the kings treasure was spoiled and carried awaie, with the prouision and ordinance that
belonged to the host.</p>

<p>The king escaping awaie, got to Yorke, and the Scots hauing thus the vpper hand, after
they had spoiled the monasterie of Riuale, and taken their pleasure there, they passed
foorth into Yorkeswold, destroieng that countrie euen almost vnto Beuerlie, which towne
they ransomed, receiuing a summe of monie for sparing it, least they should haue burnt it,
as they did other. The earle of Carleill being commanded by the king to raise the powers
of Cumberland, Westmerland, and Lancashire, did so, and according to that he had in
commandement, bringing them belowe the countries vnto Yorke, found the K. there in no
plight to giue battell to his enimies, all things being brought about him into great confusion:
wherevpon he licenced his people to depart to their homes againe, and the Scots so
returned without battell home into their countries, entring into Scotland the morrow after
All hallowes daie, after they had remained in England at this time, one whole moneth and
foure daies. Some write, that in their returne, they spoiled Northalerton, and diuerse
other townes and places as they passed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A conspiracie to set prisoners at libertie.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Sir Iohn Goldington.</div>

<p>In the same yeare, there was a great conspiracie practised by certein persons that had
taken part with the barons in the late warres, purposing to set at libertie in one selfe
night, all those noble men and others, that were by the king kept in prison for that quarrell.
Certeine therefore of those conspirators came to the castell of Walingford, within the
which the lord Maurice Berkelie, and the lord Hugh Audlie remained as prisoners. The
conspirators found shift to enter the castell by a posterne gate towards the Thames side,
howbeit not so secretlie but that the townesmen hauing knowledge thereof, assembled
togither, and besieged them that were so entred the castell, till the earles of Kent and
Winchester came with a great power to r&eacute;enforce the siege, so that in the end, they that
had made this attempt fled into the chappell of the castell, in hope to be saued through
sanctuarie of the place, but they were (against the willes of the deane and pr&eacute;ests of the
colledge there that sought to defend them) taken foorth by force, so that sir Iohn de
Goldington knight, sir Edmund of the Bech chapleine, and an esquire called Roger
Walton, were sent to Pomfret, and there put in prison; the esquire was after sent to
Yorke, and there drawne and hanged. This enterprise caused all other prisoners to be

<p>In this yeare was begun a wicked practise of treason vpon this occasion. Where K.
Edward hauing assaied fortune so froward towards him, in chance of warre against the
Scots at sundrie times, was therby taught to doubt the triall thereof any further, and rather
to s&eacute;eke for peace, he appointed Andrew Herklie earle of Carleill, to s&eacute;eke some means,
whereby a peace might be concluded betwixt him and king Robert. The earle by the
kings commandement, going into Scotland, and comming vnto king Robert, whome he
found at Loghmaban, intreated with him of warre, and not of peace; for whether it were
so that he despaired of the state of king Edwards businesse, which prospered neither at
home nor abroad; ch&eacute;efelie by reason of his owne wilfull negligence (as some write) or
whether of his owne nature this earle delighted in nothing so much, as in deceipt, craft,
and treason: he concluded vpon points with the Scotish king, how, when, and where king
Edward should be betraied, and to the end that couenanted faith on either side might be
the more suerlie kept and obserued, the sister of K. Robert was affianced vnto the said
earle of Carleill: a verie beautifull ladie and as comelie as was anie where to be s&eacute;ene or
found.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Treason will euer come to light by one meane or other.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The earle of Carleill put to death.</div>

<p>This practise being thus contriued, shortlie after the king got knowledge thereof, though
by whome it was not certeinlie knowne: so hard a thing it is for man to conceale and
k&eacute;epe secret that thing which he goeth about, though he studie neuer so much so to doo,
namelie in matters of treason, which hath a thousand f&eacute;et to cr&eacute;epe abroad, and which
way soeuer it goeth, it leaueth a thousand prints of the footsteps behind it, by the which it
may be discouered to the world. When therefore the earle came backe againe to Carleill,
he was arrested by commandement from the king, and straightwaies being arreigned
of the treason, he was thereof condemned and put to execution. His head was sent vnto
London, and there set vpon the bridge, or rather vpon some turret of the tower. So hard
a matter it is for traitors to escape the hands of the executioner; vnder whose hatchet they
submit their heads to be hewen from their shoulders, euen then when they haue conceiued

<p>&para; But there be that write otherwise (as it may well be) thus, that this earle of Carleill,
perceiuing the miserie of his countrie, without consent of the king of England, made peace
with the king of Scots, vnder this forme, as by Richard Southwell we find recorded.
First, the earle promised faithfullie for him and his heires, that they should with all their
force and means possible, s&eacute;eke to mainteine the said king of Scots, his heires and successors,
in the peaceable possession of the kingdome of Scotland, and that to their powers
they shuld fight against all those that would not agr&eacute;e vnto that couenant, as against them
that should s&eacute;eme to be enimies vnto the common-wealth of both the realmes of England
and Scotland. The king of Scots promised faithfullie for his part, to defend the said
earle, his heires, and adherents in the said couenant or paction, and not onelie to k&eacute;epe
peace with England, but also to build a monasterie within Scotland, assigning reuenues
thereto, to the value of fiue hundred marks, to celebrate diuine seruice, and to pray continuallie
for the soules of them that were dead, by occasion of the passed warres betwixt
England and Scotland; and further, that he should giue to the king of England within
ten yeares, fortie thousand pounds of siluer; and that the king of England should haue
the king of Scots eldest sonne, to marrie him vnto some ladie of his bloud, as he should
thinke expedient. To the performance of all which couenants well and truelie to be
obserued, Thomas Randulfe earle of Murrey sware on the behalfe of the king of Scots,
and the earle of Carleill sware for himselfe: and h&eacute;erewith certeine writings indented
were drawne and ingrossed, to the which interchangeablie they set their hands and
seales.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The lord Lucie.</div>

<p>After that the earle of Carleill was returned home, he called to Carleill all the ch&eacute;efe
persons of the countrie, as well spirituall as temporall, and there rather through feare,
than otherwise, constrained them to receiue an oth, that they should aid &amp; assist him to
their powers, to s&eacute;e all the couenants as abouesaid performed and kept. After that these
things were knowne to the king and the realme, although some of the communaltie liked
well inough of the matter, bicause they hoped thereby to remaine in peace, especiallie
those of the north parts, the king yet and his councell (not without cause) were sore
offended, for that he whom the king had so latelie aduanced, should confederate himselfe
with the Scots, to the preiudice of the king and his crowne, concluding any couenants of
peace without his consent, wherevpon reputing him for a ranke traitor, the king sent vnto
the lord Antonie Lucie, to apprehend the said earle by some meanes if he might, and for his
paines he should not faile to be well rewarded.</p>

<p>The lord Lucie watching his time, when the earles men were gone some whither abroad,
and but few left about him, the morrow after the feast of saint Matthew the apostle, he
entred the castell of Carleill, as it were to talke with the earle of some businesse, as his
manner was at other times to doo. He had with him sir Hugh Lowther, sir Richard Denton,
and sir Hugh Moricebie knights, and foure esquiers, beside other priuilie armed, so
that leauing some at euerie gate and doore as he entred, he came into the hall, and there
finding the earle inditing letters, arrested him. Herewith when certeine of the earles
seruants made a noise, and cried, Treason, treason, the porter of the inner gate would haue
shut it vpon them that were thus entred, but sir Richard Denton slue that porter with his
owne hands, and there was not one more slaine by them in the apprehension of the earle,
for all other his seruants y&eacute;elded themselues and the house vnto the said lord Lucie, without
more resistance.</p>

chanced to the earle, wherevpon the said Michaell foorthwith fled into Scotland, and with
him sir William Blunt knight, a Scotishman, and diuerse other that were of the earles priuie
councell. The lord Lucie streightwaies sent a messenger to the king vnto Yorke, aduertising
him how he had taken the earle, and therefore required to vnderstand further of the
kings pleasure. The king foorthwith sent the lord Geffrey Scroobe iustice, with a number
of armed men vnto Carleill, the which came thither on saint Chaddes daie, and the
morrow after, being the third of March, he sat in iudgement vpon the said earle, in the
castell of Carleill, and there (as out of the kings mouth) he pronounced sentence against
him in this wise; first, that he should be disgraded of his earledome, by the taking awaie
from him the sword which the king had gird him with, and likewise of his knighthood, by
cutting off his spurs from his h&eacute;eles, and that after this, he should be drawen from the
castell through the citie vnto the place of execution, where felons were accustomed to
suffer, and there to be hanged, afterwards headed, and then his head to be sent vnto London,
there to be set aloft vpon one of the turrets of the tower, and his quarters to be
diuided, one to be set vp at Carleill, an other at Newcastell vpon Tine, the third at Bristow,
&amp; the fourth at Douer.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Caxton.</i></div>

<p>When he had heard this iudgement, he said; "You haue diuided my bodie at your pleasure,
and I commit my soule vnto God:" and being according to the iudgement drawen
to the place where he suffered, he neuer shranke at the matter, but boldlie behaued himselfe,
declaring at the verie houre of his death, that his intention in concluding the agr&eacute;ement
with the Scots was good, and proc&eacute;eding not of any euill meaning, but tending onelie
to the wealth and quietnes of the realme. Neither could such friers as were permitted
to come to him before his arreignement to heare his confession, get any thing more of him,
but that his meaning was good, and that which he had concluded with the king of Scots
was not doone vpon any euill purpose, whereby any hurt might insue, either to the king or
to the realme. &para; Thus haue we thought good to shew the cause of this earles death, as by
some writers it hath b&eacute;ene registred; although there be that write, that the ouerthrow at
Beighland chanced through his fault, by misleading a great part of the kings host, and that
therefore the king being offended with him, caused him to be put to death, albeit (as I
thinke) no such matter was alleged against him at the time of his arreignement.</p>

<p>About this season was the foundation begun of S. Michaels colledge in Cambridge, by

to indure for thirt&eacute;ene yeares, and so about the feast of saint Barnabe the apostle, it was
proclaimed in both realmes, but yet so, that they might not traffike togither, bicause of the
excommunication wherewith the Scots were as yet intangled, although as some write, about

<div class="sidenote">The French king taketh townes in Aquitane.</div>

<p>The French K. being latelie come to the crowne, sent certeine ambassadors vnto king
Edward, to wit, the lord Beouille, and one Andreas de Florentia a notarie, to giue summons
vnto him from the French king, to come and doo homage for the lands which he held
in France, as for the duchie of Aquitaine, and the countie of Pontieu. And though the
lord chamberleine Hugh Spenser the sonne, and the lord chancellour Robert Baldocke
did what they could to procure these ambassadors, not to declare the cause of their comming
to the king, yet when they should depart, they admonished the king to come and doo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[Pg 575]</a></span>
his homage vnto the French king, and vpon this admonition the said Andreas framed a
publike instrument, by vertue whereof, the French king made processe against the king of
England, and seized into his hands diuerse townes and castels in Aquitaine, alledging that
he did it for the contumacie shewed by the king of England, in refusing to come to doo
his homage, being lawfullie summoned, although the king was throughlie informed, that
the summons was neither lawfull, nor touched him anie thing at all.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The lord Mortimer breaketh out of the towre.</div>

<p>About the same time, the lord Roger Mortimer of Wigmor, giuing his k&eacute;epers a drinke

where he was prisoner. This escape of the lord Mortimer greatlie troubled the king, so
that immediatlie vpon the first news, he wrote to all the shiriffes of the realme, that if he
chanced to come within their roomes, they should cause hue and crie to be raised, so as
he might be staied and arrested, but he made such shift, that he got ouer into France,
where he was receiued by a lord of Picardie, named monsier Iohn de Fieules, who had
faire lands in England, and therefore the king wrote to him, reprouing him of vnthankfulnesse,
considering he had b&eacute;ene euer readie to pleasure him, and to aduance his profits
and commodities, and yet notwithstanding he did succour the said lord Mortimer, and

<p>In Lent this yeare, a parlement was holden at London, in the which diuerse things
were intreated, amongst other the ch&eacute;efest was, to determine for the sending of some honorable
ambassage to the French king, to excuse the king for not comming to him to doo
his homage, according to the pretended summons. &para; In the same parlement, Adam
bishop of Hereford was arrested, and examined vpon points of treason, for aiding, succouring,
and mainteining the Mortimers, and other of the rebels. This bishop was
reckoned to be wise, subtill, and learned, but otherwise, wilfull, presumptuous, and giuen
to mainteine factions. At the first, he disdeined to make anie answer at all, and finallie,
when he was in manner forced thereto, he flatlie told the king, that he might not make
any answere to such matters as he was charged with, except by the licence and consent of
his metropolitane the archbishop of Canturburie, and other his p&eacute;eres. H&eacute;erevpon,
the said archbishop and other bishops made such sute, that he was committed to the
k&eacute;eping of the said archbishop, with him to remaine, till the king had taken order for his
further answer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The presumtuous demeanor of prelats.</div>

<p>Within few daies after, when the king called him againe before his presence, to make

and liberties of the church, tooke him awaie, before he had made anie answere,
forbidding all men on paine of excommunication, to laie anie hands vpon him. The king
greatlie offended with this bold proc&eacute;eding of the prelats, caused yet an inquest to be impanelled,
to inquire of the bishop of Herefords treasons, and vpon the finding of him
giltie, he seized into his hands all the temporalties that belonged to his bishoprike, and
spoiled his manours and houses most violentlie, in reuenge of his disloiall dealings.</p>

to enioy to them and their successors for euer. Also it was concluded, that the earle of
Kent, and the archbishop of Dubline should go ouer as ambassadours into France, to excuse
the king for his not comming in person to the French king, to doo his homage for
the lands he held in France. Moreouer, in the same parlement, the king granted, that
all the dead bodies of his enimies and rebels that had suffered and hanged still on the gallowes,
should be taken downe, and buried in the churchyards next to the places where
the same bodies were hanging, and not elsewhere, by such as would take paine to burie
them, as by his writs directed vnto the shiriffes of London, and of the counties of Middlesex,
Kent, Glocester, Yorke, and Buckingham it appeared. And not onelie this libertie
was granted at that time for the taking down of those bodies, but (as some write)

<div class="sidenote">The earle of Aniou sent into Guien.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The earle of Kent.</div>

<p>The earle of Kent, and the archbishop of Dubline going ouer into France, could not
light vpon anie good conclusion for the matter about the which they were sent, bicause
the same time, or rather somewhat before, the lord Rafe Basset of Draiton, being the
kings seneshall in Guien, had ouerthrowne a certeine towne, newlie fortified by the
Frenchmen on the frontiers, for that the inhabitants, trusting on the French kings fauour
and maintenance, refused to obeie the lawes and ordinances of the countrie of Aquitaine,
and s&eacute;emed to despise and set at naught the authoritie of the said lord Basset in that countrie,
contrarie to all right, good order or reason. Neuerthelesse, the French king tooke
the matter so gr&eacute;euouslie, that except the lord Basset might be constreined to come vnto
Paris, and there make answer to his offense, he would not hearken to anie other satisfaction.
And therevpon, when the ambassadours were returned, he sent his vncle the
lord Charles de Valois earle of Aniou, with a mightie armie, against the English subiects
into Guien, where entring into Agenois, he tooke and seized all that countrie into the
French kings hands. The earle of Kent being now gotten into those parts, with a great
number of other capteins and men of warre sent thither by the king of England, resisted
the enimies verie manfullie, in so much that vpon their approch to the Rioll, a strong
towne in those parts, the earle of Kent as then being within it, did issue foorth, and
giuing them battell, slue (as some write) fouret&eacute;ene hundred of their men, so that they
were glad to lodge at the first somewhat further off the towne.</p>

had besieged his nephue Edmund earle of Kent, within the towne of the Rioll, inforsing

all reason, and the prerogatiue of the p&eacute;eres of France, to an euill president or example
in time to come of the perpetuall seruitude of the said p&eacute;eres. "And although" saith the
king of England, "that the French alledge that we haue b&eacute;en lawfullie summoned to come

king of Aragon, requesting them to aid him with men of warre, as well horssemen as
footmen, against his aduersarie the French king, that most vniustlie went about to depriue
him of his inheritance. But howsoeuer the matter went, no aid came to the earle
of Kent from any part, till at length, the Frenchmen so reinforced the siege, that the
towne was deliuered to the earle of Aniou, and a truce taken vpon certeine conditions,
that further talke might be had, for the conclusion of some peace.</p>

<p>Then were sent ouer other ambassadors, as the lord Iohn de Sullie a Frenchman borne,
and one maister Iohn de Shordich, but the lord Sullie had so strange interteinment for

also returned home without bringing any thing to passe, of that for the which he was

the princes of either realme, to exhort them to some agr&eacute;ement, but they could doo no
good, and so taking monie of the cleargie for their expenses, they returned. After this,
about the twentith daie after Christmasse, there was a parlement called at London, in the
which the king required to haue the aduise of the lords, how he might worke for sauing

<p>But to the purpose. King Edward not a little offended with king Charles, by whose
meanes he knew that the woman thus lingered abroad, he procured pope Iohn to write
his letters vnto the French king, admonishing him to send home his sister and hir sonne
vnto hir husband. But when this nothing auailed, a proclamation was made in the moneth
of December, the ninet&eacute;enth yeare of this kings reigne, that if the qu&eacute;ene and hir sonne
entred not the land by the octaues of the Epiphanie next insuing in peaceable wise, they
should be taken for enimies to the realme and crowne of England. &para; Here authors varie,
for some write, that vpon knowledge had of this proclamation, the qu&eacute;ene determined to
returne into England foorthwith, that she might be reconciled to hir husband.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1326.</div>

<p>Others write, and that more truelie, how she being highlie displeased, both with the
Spensers and the king hir husband, that suffered himselfe to be misled by their counsels,
did appoint ind&eacute;ed to returne into England, not to be reconciled, but to stir the people
to some rebellion, wherby she might reuenge hir manifold iniuries. Which (as the proofe
of the thing shewed) s&eacute;emeth to be most true, for she being a wise woman, &amp; considering
that sith the Spensers had excluded, put out, and remooued all good men, from and besides
the kings councell, and placed in their roomes such of their clients, seruants and
fr&eacute;ends as pleased them, she might well thinke that there was small hope to be had in hir
husband, who heard no man but the said Spensers, which she knew hated hir deadlie.
Wherevpon, after that the tearme prefixed in the proclamation was expired, the king
caused to be seized into his hands, all such lands, as belonged either to his sonne, or to
his wife.</p>

constable of that castell most cruellie, and escaping awaie, got ouer to the qu&eacute;ene into

This sir Robert Walkfare was a great procurer of the discord betwixt the king and the

<p>About the same time, one sir Oliuer de Ingham, a yoong, lustie, and valiant knight,
was by the kings sonne the duke of Aquitaine (not without his fathers consent) established
lord warden of the marches of Guien, the which sir Oliuer gathering an armie of hired
soldiers, Spaniards, Aragons, and Gascoins, inuaded the countrie of Agenois (which the
French king held yet in his hands contrarie to couenant) and recouering it from the

<p>The king of England stood not onelie in doubt of the Frenchmen, but more of his owne
people that remained in France, least they thorough helpe of the French should inuade

other banished men, who in no wise could obteine anie fauour at the kings hands, so

qu&eacute;ene Isabell was destitute in manner of all helpe there, so that she was glad to withdraw
into Heinault, by the comfort of Iohn the lord Beaumont, the earle of Heinault his
brother, who being then in the court of France, and lamenting qu&eacute;ene Isabels case,
imagined with himselfe of some marriage that might be had betwixt the yoong prince of
Wales, and some of the daughters of his brother the earle of Heinault, and therevpon
required hir to go into Heinault, and he would be glad to attend hir. She gladlie consenting
hereto, went thither with him, where she was most ioifullie receiued with hir
sonne, and all other of hir traine.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Caxton.</i></div>

<p>The Spensers (some write) procured hir banishment out of France, and that she was
aduised by the earle of Arthois ch&eacute;efelie to repaire into Heinault. Also I find, that the
Spensers deliuered fiue barrels of siluer, the summe amounting vnto fiue thousand marks,
vnto one Arnold of Spaine a broker, appointing him to conueie it ouer into France, to
bestowe it vpon such fr&eacute;ends as they had there of the French kings counsell, by whose
means the king of France did banish his sister out of his relme. But this monie was met
with vpon the sea by certeine Zelanders, and taken, togither with the said Arnold, and
presented to the earle of Heinault, vnder whose dominion the Zelanders in those daies
remained, of which good hap the earle and qu&eacute;ene Isabell greatlie reioised.</p>

<p>In the time that the qu&eacute;ene and hir sonne laie in the court of the earle of Heinault, a
marriage was concluded betwixt the prince of Wales, and the ladie Philip, daughter to
the said earle, vpon certeine conditions, whereof one was, that the said erle should at his
proper costs set ouer into England the said prince of Wales, with a crue of foure hundred
men of armes. But whether there was any such mariage as then concluded, and that in
consideration thereof, the earle of Heinault aided qu&eacute;ene Isabell and hir sonne, it may
be doubted, bicause other writers make no such report. Neuerthelesse, certeine it is,
that the earls brother sir Iohn de Heinault lord Beaumont, was appointed with certeine
bands of men of arms, to the number of foure hundred or fiue hundred, to passe ouer
with the said qu&eacute;ene and hir sonne into England, and so therevpon began to make his
purueiance for that iournie, which thing when it came to the knowledge of king Edward
and the Spensers, they caused musters to be taken through the realme, and ordeined
beacons to be set vp, kept and watched, as well in the vallies by the sea side, as within
the countries, vpon hilles and high grounds, that the same vpon occasion of the enimies
arriuall, might be set on fire, to warne the countries adioining to assemble and resist

foorth towards England, landed at length in Suffolke, at an hauen called Orwell besides
Harwich, the 25 daie of September. Immediatlie after that the qu&eacute;ene and hir sonne

they still k&eacute;eping themselues n&eacute;ere to the kings person, that vnder the shadow of the

all the honour they might vnto the king, the qu&eacute;ene, and to their sonne the lawfull heire
of the land: but as for strangers &amp; traitors to the realme, they would k&eacute;epe them out of

<div class="sidenote"><i>Caxton.</i></div>

<p>The king at his departure from London, left maister Walter Stapleton the bishop of
Excester behind him, to haue the rule of the citie of London. Then shortlie after, the
qu&eacute;ene with hir son, making towards London, wrote a letter to the maior, and the citizens,
requiring to haue assistance for the putting downe of the Spensers, not onelie
knowne enimies of theirs, but also common enimies to all the realme of England. To
this letter no answer at the first was made, wherefore an other was sent, dated at Baldocke
the sixt daie of October, vnder the names of Isabell by the grace of God qu&eacute;ene of England,
ladie of Ireland, and countesse of Pontieu, and of Edward eldest sonne to the king
of England, duke of Guien, earle of Chester, of Pontieu and of Muttrell. This letter
being directed to the maior and communaltie of London, conteining in effect, that the
cause of their landing and entring into the realme at that time, was onelie for the honor
of the king and wealth of the realme, meaning hurt to no maner of person, but to the
Spensers, was fastened vpon the crosse in Cheape, then called the new crosse in Cheape,
on the night before the ninth daie of October. Diuerse copies of the same letter were
set vp, and fastened vpon windowes and doores in other places of the citie, and one of
the same copies was tacked vpon the lord maiors gates.</p>

<p>After which letter thus published in the citie, a great number of artificers, and other
that loued not to sit in rest vpon such occasion of discord offered, now that things were
in broile in other parts of the realme, assembled in great numbers, &amp; with weapon in
hand came to the lord maior of the citie, whom they knew to fauour the kings part, &amp;
therefore they forced him through feare of some iniurious violence, to receiue an oth to
stand to their ordinance, which was to put to death all those that were aduersaries to the
qu&eacute;ene, or had by any meanes procured the hinderance of the cities liberties, vnder pretext
of which oth they ran and tooke one of the citizens, called Iohn Marshall, who
bicause he was verie familiar with the earle of Glocester, and therefore suspected to haue
accused the citizens, they stroke off his head, and spoiled all his goods.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The bishop of Excester beheaded.</div>

<p>On the same day, being the fourt&eacute;enth of October, continuing their rage, they ran to
the house of the bishop of Excester, Walter de Stapleton, and setting fire on the gates,
they entred and spoiled him of all his plate, iewels, monie and goods. And as it chanced
in an infortunate houre for him, the bishop being at the same time returning from the
fields, would not s&eacute;eme to shrinke, although he was admonished of these outragious
attempts of the people; but sitting on horssebacke, came to the north doore of S. Paule,
where foorthwith the furious people laid violent hands on him, threw him downe, and
drew him most outragiouslie into Cheapeside, where they proclamed him an open traitor,
a seducer of the king, and a destroier of their liberties. The bishop had vpon him a
certeine cote of defense, which was called an aketon, the same therefore being plucked
beside his backe as all other his garments, they shore his head from his shoulders, and to
the like death they put two of his seruants, the one an esquire, and the other a yeoman.
The bishops head was set on a pole for a spectacle, that the remembrance of his death,
and the cause thereof might continue. His bodie was buried in an old churchyard of
the pied friers, without any manner of exequies of funerall seruice doone for him.</p>

<p>The chiefest cause of the enimitie which the Londoners bare towards this bishop, rose
hereof. He being lord treasuror, procured that the iustices itinerants did sit in the citie
of London, and where manie of the citizens were found offendors, and iustlie punished,
as well by loosing their fr&eacute;edoms, as by paieng their fines, and suffering corporall punishments,
they conceiued a great displeasure towards him. Moreouer, it was said, that he
had raised a great multitude of armed men against the qu&eacute;ene, and hir son the duke of
Aquitaine, and therefore did the Londoners (as they affirmed) s&eacute;eke to preuent his proc&eacute;edings.
&para; The morrow after that they had thus beheaded the bishop of Excester,
they tooke by chance sir Iohn Weston constable of the tower, and from him they tooke
the keies of the same tower, and so entering the tower, they set all the prisoners at libertie,
and in like case all those that were imprisoned in maner through the land were permitted
to go at large, and all the banished men and outlawes were likewise restored home.</p>

ceassed not to commit manie robberies &amp; other outragious &amp; most insolent parts. In the
meane time, the king being come to Bristow, left that citie in the k&eacute;eping of the earle of
Winchester. And with the earles of Glocester and Arundell, and the lord chancellor sir
Robert Baldocke, he sailed ouer into Wales, there to raise a power of Welshmen in
defense of himselfe against the qu&eacute;ene and hir adherents, which he had good hope to find
amongest the Welshmen, bicause he had euer vsed them gentlie, and shewed no rigor
towards them for their riotous misgouernance. Againe, he drew the rather into that
part, that if there were no remedie, he might easilie escape ouer into Ireland, and get

staied there a while, and still came people to hir from all sides. H&eacute;ere Adam de Torleton
the bishop of Hereford, which latelie before had b&eacute;ene sore fined by the king, for that he
was accused to stirre the people to rebellion, and to aid the barons (as y&eacute;e haue heard)
made a pithie oration to the armie, declaring that the qu&eacute;ene and hir sonne were returned
onelie into England, to the intent to persecute the Spensers, &amp; reforme the state of the
realme. And sith then that they now were come in maner to an end of the tyrannie of
most naughtie men, and of the danger that might growe dailie thereof, he exhorted them
with patient minds to beare the small trauell that remained in pursuit of the enimies; and
as for reward, they might looke for all things by the victorie, and the qu&eacute;enes liberalitie,
whose loue was such towards the common-wealth, as she onelie applied all hir endeuours

<div class="sidenote">The qu&eacute;ene goeth to Glocester.</div>

the kings brother, sir Iohn of Hennegew, with other, to take the earle of Winchester. They
did their endeuour with such diligence, that the townesmen, compounding to be saued
harmlesse in bodie and goods, deliuered the towne and castell vnto the qu&eacute;ene, &amp; to hir

Wallingford, togither with all the appurtenances to the honor of Berkley belonging.
From thence she went to Bristow, and the morrow after hir thither comming, being the
euen of the apostles Simon and Iude, through the instant calling vpon of the people,
the earle of Winchester was drawne foorth in his cote armor vnto the common gallows, and
there hanged. His head was after cut off, and sent to Winchester, whereof he was

castell of Neith, there secretlie remaining vpon trust of the Welshmens promises. &para; Hugoline
Spenser, the sonne of the earle of Glocester, defended the castell of Kersilie,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[Pg 583]</a></span>
against the power of the qu&eacute;ene and of hir sonne till easter following, and then compounding
for the safetie of his owne life, and all theirs within that castell, and likewise for the

made fealtie, in receiuing an oth of allegiance to be faithfull and loiall to him. After

<p>The qu&eacute;ene remained about a moneths space at Hereford, and in the meane while sent

might find means to apprehend the king by helpe of their acquaintance in those parts, all
thr&eacute;e of them hauing lands thereabouts, where it was knowne the king for the more part
kept. They vsed such diligence in that charge, that finallie with large gifts bestowed on

Edmund the archbishop, being the sixt&eacute;enth of Nouember, they tooke him in the monasterie
of Neith, n&eacute;ere to the castell of Laturssan, togither with Hugh Spenser the sonne
called earle of Glocester, the lord chancellour Robert de Baldocke, and Simon de Reading

Lincolne went before, and comming to Killingworth, associated with them the earle of
Leicester, of some called the earle of Lancaster, that had the king in k&eacute;eping. And
hauing secret conference with the king, they sought to frame his mind, so as he might be
contented to resigne the crowne to his sonne, bearing him in hand, that if he refused so to
doo, the people in respect of the euill will which they had conceiued against him, would
not faile but proc&eacute;ed to the election of some other that should happilie not touch him in
linage. And sith this was the onlie meane to bring the land in quiet, they willed him to
consider how much he was bound in conscience to take that waie that should be so beneficiall
to the whole realme.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The kings answer.</div>

<p>The king being sore troubled to heare such displeasant newes, was brought into a
maruelous agonie: but in the end, for the quiet of the realme and doubt of further
danger to himselfe, he determined to follow their aduise, and so when the other commissioners
were come, and that the bishop of Hereford had declared the cause wherefore
they were sent, the king in presence of them all, notwithstanding his outward countenance
discouered how much it inwardlie grieued him; yet after he was come to himselfe,
he answered that he knew that he was fallen into this miserie through his owne offenses,
and therefore he was contented patientlie to suffer it, but yet it could not (he said) but
gr&eacute;eue him, that he had in such wise runne into the hatred of all his people: notwithstanding
he gaue the lords most heartie thanks, that they had so forgotten their receiued
iniuries, and ceassed not to beare so much good will towards his sonne Edward, as to
wish that he might reigne ouer them. Therefore to satisfie them, sith otherwise it might
not be, he vtterlie renounced his right to the kingdome, and to the whole administration
thereof. And lastlie he besought the lords now in his miserie to forgiue him such offenses
as he had committed against them. Ah lamentable ruine from roialtie to miserable calamitie,
procured by them ch&eacute;efelie that should haue b&eacute;ene the pillers of the kings estate,
and not the hooked engins to pull him downe from his throne! So that here we s&eacute;e it
verefied by triall, that</p>

<p>The ambassadours with this answer returning to London, declared the same vnto all
the states, in order as they had receiued it, whervpon great ioy was made of all men, to
consider that they might now by course of law proc&eacute;ed to the choosing of a new king.
And so thervpon the nine and twentith day of Ianuarie in session of parlement then at
Westminster assembled, was the third king Edward, sonne to king Edward the second,
chosen and elected king of England, by the authoritie of the same parlement, first (as
before is said) confirmed by his fathers resignation: and the first day of his reigne they
agr&eacute;ed to be the fiue and twentith of Ianuarie, in the yeare 1326 after the account of the
church of England, beginning the yeare the fiue &amp; twentith day of March, but by the
common account of writers, it was in the yeare 1327. &para; On the same daie sir William
Trusell procurator for the whole parlement did renounce the old king in name of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[Pg 586]</a></span>
whole parlement, with all homages and fealties due to him, so that the same fiue and
twentith day of Ianuarie hath b&eacute;ene reputed and taken for the first day of the beginning
of king Edward the third his reigne, so that whatsoeuer chanced before that day, is
ascribed to be doone during the reigne of his father.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Thom. de la More.</i></div>

<p>But now to make an end of the life, as well as of the reigne of king Edward the second,
I find that after he was deposed of his kinglie honour and title, he remained for a time
at Killingworth, in custodie of the earle of Leicester. But within a while the qu&eacute;ene
was informed by the bishop of Hereford, (whose hatred towards him had no end) that
the erle of Leicester fauoured hir husband too much, and more than stood with the suertie
of hir sonnes state, wherevpon he was appointed to the k&eacute;eping of two other lords,
Thomas Berkley, and Iohn Matreuers, who receiuing him of the earle of Leicester the
third of Aprill, conueied him from Killingworth vnto the castell of Berkley, situate not
farre off from the riuer of Seuerne, almost the midwaie betwixt Glocester and Bristow.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sir Thomas Gourney.</div>

<p>But forsomuch as the lord Berkley vsed him more courteouslie than his aduersaries
wished him to doo, he was discharged of that office, and sir Thomas Gourney appointed
in his stead, who togither with the lord Matreuers conueied him secretlie (for feare least
he should be taken from them by force) from one strong place to another, as to the
castell of Corfe, and such like, still remoouing with him in the night season, till at length
they thought it should not be knowne whither they had conueied him. And so at length
they brought him backe againe in secret maner vnto the castell of Berkley, where whilest
he remained (as some write) the qu&eacute;ene would send vnto him courteous and louing letters
with apparell and other such things, but she would not once come n&eacute;ere to visit him,
bearing him in hand that she durst not, for feare of the peoples displeasure, who hated
him so extreamelie. Howbeit, she with the rest of hir confederats had (no doubt) laid
the plot of their deuise for his dispatch, though by painted words she pretended a kind
of remorse to him in this his distresse, &amp; would s&eacute;eme to be faultlesse in the sight of the
world; for</p>

<div class="sidenote">The earle of Kent conspireth to deliuer his brother.</div>

<p>But as he thus continued in prison, closelie kept, so that none of his fr&eacute;ends might
haue accesse vnto him, as in such cases it often happeneth, when men be in miserie, some
will euer pitie their state, there were diuerse of the nobilitie (of whome the earle of Kent
was ch&eacute;efe) began to deuise means by secret conference had togither, how they might
restore him to libertie, discommending greatlie both qu&eacute;ene Isabell, and such other as
were appointed gouernours to the yoong king, for his fathers streict imprisonment. The
qu&eacute;ene and other the gouernours vnderstanding this conspiracie of the earle of Kent,
and of his brother, durst not yet in that new and gr&eacute;ene world go about to punish it, but
rather thought good to take awaie from them the occasion of accomplishing their purpose.
And herevpon the qu&eacute;ene and the bishop of Hereford wrote sharpe letters vnto his
k&eacute;epers, blaming them greatlie, for that they dealt so gentlie with him, and kept him no
streictlier, but suffered him to haue such libertie, that he aduertised some of his fr&eacute;ends
abroad how and in what manner he was vsed, and withall the bishop of Hereford vnder a
sophisticall forme of words signified to them by his letters, that they should dispatch him
out of the waie, the tenor whereof wrapped in obscuritie ran thus:</p>

<p>Which riddle or doubtfull kind of sp&eacute;ech, as it might be taken in two contrarie senses,
onelie by placing the point in orthographic called C&#x014D;ma, they construed in the worse
sense, putting the Comma after Timere, and so presuming of this commandement as they
tooke it from the bishop, they lodged the miserable prisoner in a chamber ouer a foule
filthie dungeon, full of dead carrion, trusting so to make an end of him, with the abhominable
stinch thereof: but he bearing it out stronglie, as a man of a tough nature, conti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[Pg 587]</a></span>nued
still in life, so as it s&eacute;emed he was verie like to escape that danger, as he had by

<p>Wherevpon when they sawe that such practises would not serue their turne, they came
suddenlie one night into the chamber where he laie in bed fast asl&eacute;epe, and with heauie
featherbeds or a table (as some write) being cast vpon him, they kept him down and
withall put into his fundament an horne, and through the same they thrust vp into his
bodie an hot spit, or (as other haue) through the pipe of a trumpet a plumbers instrument
of iron made verie hot, the which passing vp into his intrailes, and being rolled to
and fro, burnt the same, but so as no appearance of any wound or hurt outwardlie might
be once perceiued. His crie did mooue manie within the castell and towne of Berkley
to compassion, plainelie hearing him vtter a wailefull noise, as the tormentors were about
to murther him, so that diuerse being awakened therewith (as they themselues confessed)
praied heartilie to God to receiue his soule, when they vnderstood by his crie what the

<div class="sidenote">The fond opinion of the ignorant people.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The nature &amp; disposition of king Edward the second.</div>

<p>The qu&eacute;ene, the bishop, and others, that their tyrannie might be hid, outlawed and
banished the lord Matreuers, and Thomas Gourney, who flieng vnto Marcels, thr&eacute;e
yeares after being knowne, taken, and brought toward England was beheaded on the sea,
least he should accuse the chiefe dooers, as the bishop and other. Iohn Matreuers,
repenting himselfe, laie long hidden in Germanie, and in the end died penitentlie. Thus
was king Edward murthered, in the yeare 1327, on the 22 of September. The fame
went that by this Edward the second, after his death manie miracles were wrought. So
that the like opinion of him was conceiued as before had b&eacute;ene of earle Thomas of Lancaster,
namelie amongst the common people. He was knowne to be of a good and
courteous nature, though not of most pregnant wit.</p>

<p>And albeit in his youth he fell into certeine light crimes, and after by the companie
and counsell of euill men, was induced vnto more heinous vices, yet was it thought that
he purged the same by repentance, and patientlie suffered manie reproofes, and finallie
death it selfe (as before ye haue heard) after a most cruell maner. He had suerlie good
cause to repent his former trade of liuing, for by his vndiscr&eacute;et and wanton misgouernance,
there were headed and put to death during his reigne (by iudgement of law) to the
number of 28 barons and knights, ouer and beside such as were slaine in Scotland by his
infortunate conduct.</p>

<p>All these misch&eacute;efes and manie more happened not onlie to him, but also to the whole
state of the realme, in that he wanted iudgement and prudent discretion to make choise
of sage and discr&eacute;et councillors, receiuing those into his fauour, that abused the same to
their priuate gaine and aduantage, not respecting the aduancement of the common-wealth,
so they themselues might atteine to riches and honour, for which they onelie sought, in
somuch that by their couetous rapine, spoile, and immoderate ambition, the hearts of
the common people &amp; nobilitie were quite estranged from the dutifull loue and obedience
which they ought to haue shewed to their souereigne, going about by force to
wrest him to follow their wils, and to s&eacute;eke the destruction of them whome he commonlie
fauoured, wherein suerlie they were worthie of blame, and to tast (as manie of them did)
the deserued punishment for their disobedient and disloiall demeanors. For it was not
the waie which they tooke to helpe the disfigured state of the common-wealth, but rather
the readie meane to ouerthrow all, as if Gods goodnesse had not b&eacute;ene the greater it must
n&eacute;eds haue come to passe, as to those that shall well consider the pitifull tragedie of this
kings time it may well appeare.</p>

yet aliue, and Iohn which died yoong: also two daughters, Elianor which died before
she came to yeares able for mariage; and Ione which was after giuen in marriage vnto
Dauid king of Scotland. He was indifferentlie tall of stature, strong of bodie, and
healthfull, neither wanted there in him stoutnesse of stomach, if his euill councellors had
b&eacute;ene remooued, that he might haue shewed it in honorable exploits, which being kept
backe by them, he could not doo. So that thereby it appeareth of what importance it is
to be trained vp in youth with good and honest companie. &para; It is said that he was
learned, insomuch that there remaine verses, which (as some haue written) he made
whilest he was in prison. Certeine it is he fauoured lerning, as by the erection of Oriall
colledge in Oxford, &amp; S. Maries hall, which were of his foundation, it may well be
